# WordPress Widget Boilerplate

The WordPress Widget Boilerplate serves as a foundation off of which to build your WordPress widgets. 

## Features

* The Widget Boilerplate is fully-based on the WordPress [Widget API](http://codex.wordpress.org/Widgets_API)
* Uses [PHPDoc](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHPDoc) conventions for easily following the code
* Liberal use of `TODO` to guide you through what you need to change
* Uses a strict file organization scheme to make sure the assets are easily maintainable

## Usage

The WordPress Widget Boilerplate is ready to activate as-is (though it includes no real functionality).

1. Copy the `widget-boilerplate` directory into your `wp-content/plugins` directory
2. Navigate to the "Plugins" dashboard page
3. Locate the menu item that reads "TODO"
4. Click on "Activate"

This will activate the WordPress Widget Boilerplate. Because the Boilerplate has no real functionality, nothing will be added to WordPress; however, this demonstrates exactly how your widget should behave as you're working with it.
